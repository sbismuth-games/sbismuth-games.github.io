        <p>
            The game does not collect nor send any user data. it doesn't access network nor localization services. 
            Informations about the user's actions (best scores, progression,  ...) may be stored on the device that runs the game, but will not be sent to anyone.

        <h3>Why this?</h3>

        <p>
            Privacy policies are mandatory for Google Play apps. So here it is. I don't think anyone will read this anyway.
