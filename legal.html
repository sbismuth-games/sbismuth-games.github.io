        <h1>Privacy policy</h1>

        <p>
            This is the privacy policy for all games that redirects here (Color Panic, Eyes and Blobs, This is not a Word).
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The game does not collect any personal user data. The game does not interact with the internet, therefore all data stored by the game stays on the device.
        </p>

        <h3>Why this?</h3>

        <p>
            Privacy policies are mandatory for Google Play apps. So here it is. I don't think anyone will read this anyway.
